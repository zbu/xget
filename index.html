xget was created to provide simple, seamless downloads 
of files from the web without security warnings, 
firewalls or the likes. It's ideal for open source web
developers who want to allow downloads of their programs
without having the users being prompted that the file is
insecure just because it doesn't have an expensive code
signing certificate. Simply download xget.bat (works on
Windows 7+ only) and start using it! For security, only
files in the xget repository can be downloaded, so you
need to send us an email so we can look over your 
software and approve it before it is possible to get 
with xget. To request for a file to be added to the xget
repository, please open up a new issue with the title 
being xget request: your program, and the comment being
a link to your software.
